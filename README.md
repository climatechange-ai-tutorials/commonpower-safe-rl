# Empowering Safe Reinforcement Learning for Power System Control with CommonPower
This tutorial introduces the CommonPower library, designed to benchmark safe reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms on control problems for power systems. We highlight two crucial issues in RL for power system control: safeguarding RL decision-making and assessing the impact of forecast quality on control performance. Participants will learn how to use CommonPower to further invesitigate these topics.
